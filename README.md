## Project title: Timing the Market using the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
## Team members
* Laramie
* Ying
* Joe

## Project description/outline
Use historical VIX data and SPY data to:

    1. Better inform investment timing
    2. Create better predictions of portfolio performance
    using a modified monte carlo simulation

## Research questions to answer 
Can the CBOE Volatility Index (or others) be used to time the market?
How best to use volatility indexes with monte carlo simulation? And how to use those simulations to inform investment decisions?

High level we want to provide: 
    Proof that Volatility Index's have correlation to SPY
    Proof that Volatility Index can be predicted (or not)
    Proof that investing at certain Volatility Index markers can increase gains

## Datasets to be used 
CBOE volatility index historical data (CBOE.com)
SPY historical data (Alpaca api)

## Rough breakdown of tasks

1. Data Wrangling -- get mult. vol indexes
2. Basic Monte Carlo sims
3. Drawing Board

    A. Nail down moded monte carlo params

    B. How far do we go with visuals interactivity of visuals

### General Data Exploration
---
Correlation Analysis between VIX and market
PID tuning related to algorithimic trading
Monte Carlo the VIX -- troubleshoot
Modify the Monte Carlo Simulation to consider VIX

## Usage
Code used for analysis found in the Notebooks folder.

Visualizations can be found in the Presentation folder
