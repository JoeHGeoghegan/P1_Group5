## Project title: Timing the Market using the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
## Team members
* Laramie
* Ying
* Joe

## Project description/outline
Use historical VIX data and SPY data to:

    1. Better inform investment timing
    2. Create better predictions of portfolio performance
    using a modified monte carlo simulation

## Research questions to answer 
Can the CBOE Volatility Index (or others) be used to time the market?

How best to use volatility indexes with monte carlo simulation? And how to use those simulations to inform investment decisions?

## Datasets to be used 
CBOE volatility index historical data (CBOE.com)
SPY historical data (Alpaca api)

## Rough breakdown of tasks

1. Data Wrangling -- get mult. vol indexes
2. Basic Monte Carlo sims
3. Drawing Board

    A. Nail down moded monte carlo params

    B. How far do we go with visuals interactivity of visuals

### General Data Exploration
---
Correlation Analysis between VIX and market
PID tuning related to algorithimic trading
Monte Carlo the VIX -- troubleshoot
Modify the Monte Carlo Simulation to consider VIX

Tasks by Saturday:

Laramie: get volatility index data and spy data
Joe: Data wrangling into pd dataframes
Ying: MonteCarlo sim on joe's dfs
